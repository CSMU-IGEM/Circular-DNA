Circular-DNA Modeling - Circular DNA Design

Our Circular DNA Design Software is made from the Python coding language. 
This software is built for GotCha's mechanism based on Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). 
With user input of target micro-RNA sequence for capture, Circular DNA Design is able to synthesise different permutations of bases to form circular DNA sequences suitable for GotCha with the help of rules we established in circular DNA design. 
With various rules established, we successfully avoid formation of major loops in circular DNA sequences while maximising thermodynamic stability.
